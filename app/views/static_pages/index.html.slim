        Beyond our regular monthly meetings, our members make posts about their experiences with stuttering. Whether they themselves stutter, or they are or have been a SLP (speech-language pathologist), each person has had personal/professional experience with stuttering and offer unique insights of it. Feel free to read a few posts, comment on some, or submit your own!
